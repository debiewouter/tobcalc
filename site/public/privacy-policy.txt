None of the information you submit or write on tobcalc is sent to any servers. The processing of transaction history files as well as PDF generation is done in the browser. Certain text inputs such as your name, address and so on is saved in the browser so you don't have to re-enter those details every time you visit the site. Your national registration number (rijksregisternummer) is _not_ saved in local storage just to be extra safe in the case that a script in the site might be compromised and data could be leaked.

In terms of analytics, tobcalc uses [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com). Simple Analytics uses a number of different factors to determine if a website visit is unique or not. To keep it short, they do _not_ use your IP address, but they do use (and sometimes store) things such as your user agent, the timestamp of requests, the referrer and so on. See how they do it in more detail here: https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/what-we-collect. On top of that, when you click on the "Download PDF" button, a request is made to Simple Analytics to count this event. No other information is sent, literally just the fact that the button was clicked.

Lastly, the website is hosted on Netlify and served by Cloudflare.
